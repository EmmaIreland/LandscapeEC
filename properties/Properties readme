SEED: seeds a random number generator for a particular run <long>


PROBLEM_EVALUATOR: the fitness calculator for a given problem <fully qualified class name>
PROBLEM_TYPE: specifies the problem that we are solving <fully qualified class name>
PROBLEM_PARSER: constructs an instance of problem type based on a specification file for 
				a problem instance <fully qualified class name>
PROBLEM_FILE: specifies the specification file that will be given to the problem parser <fully qualified class name>


WORLD_TYPE: landscapeEC.locality.GridWorld or landscapeEC.locality.GraphWorld
WORLD_DIMENSIONS: Only meaningful for GridWorld? The dimensions of the world as a list of ints <int, int>
FILE:
TOROIDAL: for GridWorlds. Specifies whether or not the wraps around at the edges <boolean>
STARTING_POPULATION: Specifies what locations are initially populated <string[ORIGIN, CORNERS]>


QUIT_ON_SUCCESS: determines if a run will terminate upon success or only when its completed 
					the specified number of evaluations <boolean>

NUM_RUNS: determines the number of times this configuration of parameters will be run <int>
NUM_EVALS_TO_DO: sets the number of maximum evaluations a run will use before failing <int>
REPORTING_INTERVALS: a number between 0 and 1 that indicates what fraction of the evaluations 
					should pass between snapshots. A value that is greater than 1 will turn off snapshots.


AVERAGE_MUTATIONS: specifies the average number of bits that will be modified in a mutation operation <int>
REPRODUCTION_RATE: sets the number of individuals that will be produced from a crossover operation <int>
ELITE_PROPORTION: determines what proportion of the best performing individuals will survive for the next generation <double>
CARRYING_CAPACITY: sets the maximum number of individuals in a location <int>
PROMOTE_SMALL_POPULATIONS: determines whether or not we use a single individual as both parents if 
					there's only one individual in a location <boolean>
REAPER_EFFECT: determines what happens to an individual if it can't satisfy the problem in its 
					location set by its locality <string[DRACONIAN, FITNESS]>
TOURNAMENT_SIZE: sets the number of individuals that are compared when selecting a parent <int>
MIGRATION_PROBABILITY: sets the chance of an individual to migrate <double>
MIGRATION_DISTANCE: sets how many locations an individual can move through to migrate to a location <int> GRIDWORLD ONLY
MUTATION_OPERATOR: specifies the mutation operation that we used <fully qualified class name>
SELECTION_OPERATOR: specifies the selection operation that we used <fully qualified class name>
CROSSOVER_OPERATOR: specifies the crossover operation that we used <fully qualified class name>


OBSERVERS: specifies what visualizer will be used <a list of fully qualified class names>
VISUALIZER_X_SCALE: sets the size for the length of the x axis of the visualizer <int>
VISUALIZER_Y_SCALE: sets the size for the length of the y axis of the visualizer <int>
VISUALIZER_INTENSITY_SCALE: this value is the exponent used to scale fitness values in map visualizer. 
							Larger values increase detail in high fitness values at the expense of detail 
							and low fitness values.
VISUALIZER_TYPE: sets what attribute the visualizer will display <string BRIGHT_MUTATION, COLORED_CLAUSES, FITNESS>


GEOGRAPHY_TYPE: sets the geography <fully qualified class name>  
GEOGRAPHY_NOISE_STRENGTH: specifies the amount of randomized used in fractal geography. float between 0 
							and 1. High values increase the amount of noise in the landscape.


VIRAL_CLAUSE_THRESHOLD: When individuals with the same semantics have dominated the world for more than this number
						 of generations then a unsolved clause will be added to the viral clause set.
VIRAL_CLAUSES: turns viral clauses on or off <boolean>


SKIP_DIVERSITY: if this is true, the diversity calculation is skipped. Some variants of the system depend on 
				the diversity calculator being on but turning it off can speed up the system.
				TODO: variants that need this should turn it on.


LOCALITY_TYPE: We're asking Casey about this.
