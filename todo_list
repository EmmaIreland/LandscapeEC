Landscape EC Todo List
-------------------------------------------------


------- TO DO -------


----- COMPLETED -----
- Reconfigure elitism to be able to use the clause list contained within each location, in order
to get the "elite" of a location that has geography.

- Set up Locations to be able to contain a list of clauses, in order for geography to work.

- Figure out what we want to do about reproduction. We will probably need to change reproduction so that 
two individuals in a cell will not instantly fill the cell to carrying capacity with their children.

- We need to fix the clock to stop counting the number of generations and instead measure the time spent working on a 
problem in another way. Perhaps by counting fitness evaluations, using a parameter set in the properties file.
