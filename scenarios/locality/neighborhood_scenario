Scenario: Generate a neighboorhood

As a machine learning researcher
I want to be able to generate a neighborhood of a location
in order to find potential mates for an individual

Given a non-toroidal world of size [10]
When I compute the neighborhood of [5] with radius 1
Then the neighborhood contains:
[4]
[5]
[6]

Given a non-toroidal world of size [10]
When I compute the neighborhood of [5] with radius 3
Then the neighborhood contains:
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]

Given a non-toroidal world of size [10]
When I compute the neighborhood of [8] with radius 3
Then the neighborhood contains:
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]

Given a toroidal world of size [10]
When I compute the neighborhood of [8] with radius 3
Then the neighborhood contains:
[0]
[1]
[5]
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
