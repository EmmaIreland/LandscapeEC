Scenario: Evaluate a Sat Solution

As an machine learning researcher
I want to be able to correctly evaluate
a solution to a SAT problem

Given a sat evaluator
When I have a bitstring of <bitstring> 
And I have this clauseList
1 2 3
-1 2 -3
1 2 -3
1 -2 3
Then the fitness should be <fitness>
Then the evaluation count should be <count>

Examples:

|bitstring|fitness|count|
|100|1|1|
|001|0.75|2|
|101|0.75|3|
|111|1|4|
|000|0.75|5|
